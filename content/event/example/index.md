title: "α4βδ GABAA receptors trigger synaptic pruning during adolescence in
  layer 5 of the prelimbic medial prefrontal cortex. "
abstract: The removal of excitatory synapses during puberty is an essential
  occurrence by which neural circuits are streamlined, thus permitting optimal
  function. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is one of the primary regions
  implicated in anxiety disorders which occur more frequently in women. Abnormal
  synaptic pruning of mPFC may influence the development of these disorders. Our
  lab has previously reported that in CA1 hippocampus the emergence of α4βδ
  GABAAreceptors (GABARs) initiates synaptic pruning (Afroz et al., 2016) at
  puberty. This study investigates if the same mechanism initiates synaptic
  pruning in Layer 5 of the prelimbic mPFC (PL). We used Golgi staining to
  assess spine density comparing pubertal (P35, assessed by vaginal opening) vs.
  post-pubertal (P56) female mice. Individual neurons were viewed using a 100x
  oil objective on a Nikon Eclipse Ci-L microscope and scanned using Z-stack
  projection photomicrographs (0.1 μm steps) taken using a Nikon DS-U3 camera.
  Spine density/typing was done in Neurolucida 360 across the entire basal
  dendrite or in distal and proximal regions. Spine density decreased 40%~
  across adolescence (8.9 ± 0.73 spines/10 μm, pub vs. 5.5 ± 0.38 spines/10 μm,
  post-pub, P<0.05) with mushroom spines showing the greatest decrease (~62%,
  1.8 ± 0.23 spines/10 μm, pub; 0.66 ± 0.12 spines/10 μm, post-pub, P<0.05).
  Spine density of the distal portion exhibited a ~35% decrease in spine density
  (11.1 ± 0.9 spines/10 μm, pub, 7.3 ± 0.7 spines/10 μm, post-pub, P<0.05) with
  mushroom spines, again, showing the greatest decline (~57%, 2.2 ± 0.28
  spines/10 μm, pub; 0.93 ± 0.18 spines/10 μm, post-pub, P<0.05). While the
  proximal region did not have a significant decline in spine density mushroom
  spines significantly decreased (~77%, 1.3 ± 0.23 spines/10 μm, pub; 0.30 ±
  0.11 spines/10 μm, post-pub, P<0.05). To test the role of α4βδ GABARs, we
  assessed α4 expression using immunohistochemistry; α4 expression increased at
  puberty, (mean ± S.E.M. t(18)=12.6, *P=2.2 x 10-10), localized to the spine
  head and dendritic shaft. Functional expression of α4βδ GABARs at puberty was
  confirmed by a 10-fold greater response of pyramidal cells to 100 nM
  gaboxadol, which is selective for α4βδ, compared to pre-puberty, (assessed
  using whole cell patch clamp recordings). Finally, to establish the role of
  pubertal α4βδ GABARs in pruning of this region, we compared spine
  density/spine types from pubertal and post-pubertal α4 knock-out mice. Unlike
  wild-type mice, there were no significant differences in spine density or type
  across adolescence. Taken together these data suggest that in Layer 5 of the
  PL adolescent synaptic pruning is initiated by the emergence of α4βδ GABARs.
