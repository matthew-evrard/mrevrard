abstract: The effect of mindfulness meditation on false-memory susceptibility
  was examined in three experiments. Because mindfulness meditation encourages
  judgment-free thoughts and feelings, we predicted that participants in the
  mindfulness condition would be especially likely to form false memories. In
  two experiments, participants were randomly assigned to either a mindfulness
  induction, in which they were instructed to focus attention on their
  breathing, or a mind-wandering induction, in which they were instructed to
  think about whatever came to mind. The overall number of words from the
  Deese-Roediger-McDermott paradigm that were correctly recalled did not differ
  between conditions. However, participants in the mindfulness condition were
  significantly more likely to report critical nonstudied items than
  participants in the control condition. In a third experiment, which tested
  recognition and used a reality-monitoring paradigm, participants had reduced
  reality-monitoring accuracy after completing the mindfulness induction. These
  results demonstrate a potential unintended consequence of mindfulness
  meditation in which memories become less reliable.
